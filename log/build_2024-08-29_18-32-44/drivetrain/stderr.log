[33mCMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:12 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findstring__struct.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "string__struct", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "string__struct"
  with any of the following names:

    string__structConfig.cmake
    string__struct-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "string__struct" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "string__struct_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "string__struct" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
